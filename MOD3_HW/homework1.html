        <p>Thank you for coming to my site. It is a work in progress, so I appreciate you bearing with me in this!</p>
        <p>I'm a San Francisco native and worked in all sorts of kitchens, from fine dining to more casual spots as a sous chef and cook. However, because of the pandemic I decided it was time for a career change. I wanted to find something that offered a better work life balance and compensation than my previous career, while still offering the potential for creative freedom.</p>
        <p>I knew I wanted to work in the tech industry, but not specifically what sector. It was by chance I stumbled across vlogs on youtube with content about "Day in the life of ___," that I viewed a channel created by a front end developer named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu1xbgCV5o48h_BYCQD7KJg" target="blank">Chris Sean</a>. He was personable and enthusiatic about his career in front end development and like me, he did not have a degree, was not a perfect student, came from a background totally unrelated to the tech world, and yet he managed to turn his life around and found success by learning how to code.</p>

            <li><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths" target="blank"><strong>The Odin Project</strong></a><br>
                A really good repository contributed by volunteers, that combed the internet for the best resources available at the moment to help you understand the subject. It links to outside sources, such as freecodecamp and mozilla documents for you to get a solid foundation. The discord channel is helpful as long as you tried to figure things out on your own first. I am slowly working my way through the curriculum, but I find it a good starting point.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="blank"><strong>FreeCodeCamp</strong></a><br>
                This site has a good amount of hand holding when you go through the free lessons. You should really read the hints provided in each lesson to get a more in depth explanation to the solution, even if you don't require the hint.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/" target="blank"><strong>Reddit subreddit /webdev</strong></a><br>
                This subreddit gave me some clues to where I should start out if I wanted to try the self-taught method. Plenty of people here recommended The Odin Project as a good place to start off and they also gave me a general idea of what was required to succeed in this career. Plenty of real life experiences and stories about the industry here.</li>
